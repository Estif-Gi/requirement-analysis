# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in the software development lifecycle (SDLC) where stakeholders, business analysts, and developers collaborate to define, document, and validate the needs and expectations for a software system. Its primary goals are:

Clarity & Understanding – Ensures all stakeholders (clients, users, developers) have a shared vision of the software’s functionality, constraints, and objectives.

Scope Definition – Prevents misunderstandings by clearly outlining what the system will (and will not) do, reducing the risk of scope creep.

Feasibility Assessment – Evaluates technical, economic, and operational practicality before development begins.

Foundation for Design & Development – Serves as a blueprint for architects, developers, and testers to build and validate the system.

Risk Mitigation – Identifies potential conflicts, ambiguities, or gaps early, saving time and costs in later stages.

# What is Requirement Analysis? 

Requirement Analysis is the process of identifying, documenting, and validating the needs and constraints of stakeholders to define what a software system must do. It is a crucial phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) that ensures the final

# Why is Requirement Analysis Important?,

  1. Ensures You Build the Right Product
Prevents costly misunderstandings by clarifying exactly what needs to be built

Aligns developer understanding with stakeholder expectations

Example: Without proper analysis, you might build a web app when stakeholders actually needed a mobile app

2. Saves Time and Money
Fixing errors in requirements costs 10-100x more if discovered late in development (IBM Systems Sciences Institute)

Reduces unnecessary rework by identifying problems early

Example: Catching a missing regulatory requirement early avoids legal penalties later

3. Improves Project Success Rates
71% of failed projects cite poor requirements as primary cause (PMI)

Clear requirements lead to more accurate timelines and budgets

Example: Well-defined scope prevents endless "just one more feature" requests
