# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in the software development lifecycle (SDLC) where stakeholders, business analysts, and developers collaborate to define, document, and validate the needs and expectations for a software system. Its primary goals are:

Clarity & Understanding – Ensures all stakeholders (clients, users, developers) have a shared vision of the software’s functionality, constraints, and objectives.

Scope Definition – Prevents misunderstandings by clearly outlining what the system will (and will not) do, reducing the risk of scope creep.

Feasibility Assessment – Evaluates technical, economic, and operational practicality before development begins.
